/* Rubrics for Foundation 3: Inheritance with Event Planning
 * 1. Abstraction
 *   - Classes exist for the base class and each type of event.
 *
 * 2. Encapsulation
 *   - All member variables are private, or they are protected if a derived class needs direct access.
 *
 * 3. Inheritance Hierarchy
 *   - Each specific type of event is derived from a base class.
 *
 * 4. Inheriting Attributes
 *   - All member variables that could be shared among classes are defined in the base class
 *   (including title, description date, time, and address).
 *
 * 4. Inheriting Behaviours
 *   - All methods that could be shared among classes are defined in the base class (including methods for
 *   getting the standard details and short description).
 *
 * 5. Functionality
 *   - Program runs without errors. Each type of event is created, values set, and methods are used to generate all
 *   required marketing messages (Standard details, Full details, Short description).
 *
 * 6. Style: Whitespace
 *   - Vertical and horizontal whitespace (blank lines, indentation, braces) is correct throughout the program.
 *
 * 7. Naming Conventions
 *   - Classes and methods use TitleCase, member variables use _underscoreCamelCase, local variables use camelCase.
