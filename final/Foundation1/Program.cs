/* Rubrics for Foundation 1: Abstraction with YouTube Videos
 * 1. Abstraction: Video Class
 *   - A Video class exists and has a way to track the title, author, and length.
 *
 * 2. Abstraction: Comment Class
 *   - A Comment class exists that stores the name of the person and the text of the comment.
 *
 * 3. Class Composition
 *   - The Video class stores a list of Comment class objects.
 *
 * 4. Class Behaviors
 *   - The Video class contains a method that returns the number of comments directly from the way comments
 *     are stored (for example returns the length of the list).
 *
 * 5. Functionality: Object Creation
 *   - Program runs without errors. It correctly creates at least 3 Video objects (including setting their values),
 *    and for each Video creates and sets at least 3 Comment objects (including setting their values).
 *    The Video objects are stored in a list.
 *
 * 6. Functionality: Object Use
 *   - Program runs without errors. It iterates through a list of Video objects and for each one displays the title,
 *    author, length, and number of comments (using the method) and for each video also displays the comments for that
 *    video (include the commenter's name and text).
 *
 * 7. Style: Whitespace
 *   - Vertical and horizontal whitespace (blank lines, indentation, braces) is correct throughout the program.
 *
 * 7. Style: Naming Conventions
 *   - Classes and methods use TitleCase, member variables use _underscoreCamelCase, local variables use camelCase.
