/* Rubrics for Foundation 2: Encapsulation with Online Ordering
 * 1. Abstraction Classes
 *   - All classes in the specification are created and contain the required attributes.
 *   Class composition is used correctly for each of the class relationships (classes contain instances of other classes).
 *
 * 2. Encapsulation: Information Hiding
 *   - All classes in the specification are created and contain the required attributes. Class composition is used
 *   correctly for each of the class relationships (classes contain instances of other classes).
 *
 * 3. Functionality: Object Creation
 *   - Program runs without errors. At least 2 Order objects are created. Each Order object contains at least 2 Product
 *   objects. Each Order object contains a Customer object. Each Customer object contains an Address object.
 *   Values are set for each member variable of these objects.
 *
 * 4. Functionality: Behaviors
 *   - Program runs without errors. For each order, the program calculates and displays the total cost.
 *   The program also calls methods to get packing and shipping labels and displays the results of these labels
 *   containing all required information.
 *
 * 5. Style: Whitespace
 *   - Vertical and horizontal whitespace (blank lines, indentation, braces) is correct throughout the program.
 *
 * 5. Style: Naming Conventions
 *   - Classes and methods use TitleCase, member variables use _underscoreCamelCase, local variables use camelCase.
