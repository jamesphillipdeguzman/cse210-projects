Single file (but doesn't work)

dotnet publish -r win-x64 -p:PublishSingleFile=true -c Release

It could be going to the release folder, though.




Publish all files (this works)

dotnet publish -c Release -r win-x64 --self-contained=true /p:PublishSingleFile=true /p:IncludeAllContentForSelfExtract=true /p:PublishTrimmed=true -o ./publish
